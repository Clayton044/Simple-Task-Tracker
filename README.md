# 📝 Simple Task Tracker

A beginner-friendly **To-Do List** web app built using **HTML** and **JavaScript**.  
It allows users to add, edit, mark as done, and delete tasks — with a minimal and interactive interface.

## Features

✅ Add new tasks  
✅ Edit existing tasks  
✅ Mark tasks as done (with strikethrough style)  
✅ Delete tasks  
✅ Automatic message when no tasks are available  
✅ Right-click or click menu for quick task actions

## How It Works

- Tasks are stored in a simple JavaScript array (`tasks`).
- Each task is displayed dynamically in an ordered list.
- When you click on a task, a small context menu appears with options:
  - ✏️ **Edit** — modify the task text  
  - ✅ **Mark Done** — toggle done/undone  
  - 🗑️ **Delete** — remove the task
